# Vast-Challenge
The VAST challenge is an annual international visual analytics competition. Mistford is a 
mid-size city to the southwest of the Boonsong Lekagul Wildlife Preserve. The city has a small 
industrial area with four light-manufacturing endeavors. Mistford and the wildlife preserve are 
struggling with the possible endangerment of the Rose-Crested Blue Pipit, a locally loved bird. The 
bird ºs nesting pairs seem to have decreased alarmingly. We have a dataset and The visualisation tool 
used in this analysis is vega-altair.
This Altair code leverages the potentials of visual analysis to identify insights of a dataset. It
seeks to reveal trends, outliers and patterns via well-designed plots and levels. This is a case where 
each function has meaning as well as each aesthetic element, which allows for a detailed analysis of 
the data set characteristics. This flexibility in the code facilitates visualization, a crucial aspect for 
analysts who want to discover facts and produce informed conclusions.
